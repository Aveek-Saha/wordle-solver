# Rules

-   The bot plays Wordle in hard mode, i.e. any information from a guess has to be used in the subsequent guesses.
-   The bot uses the list of all valid words + the list of answers from the official wordle website, a total of about 13k words.
-   The list of possible answers is not given any special treatment and is mixed with the list of valid words.

# Stats

The bot was tested on all 2309 Wordle answer words and these are the results.

## Regular

A regular test run means the result was considered a failure if the bot could not solve the puzzle in 6 or fewer tries. The average score excludes the failed puzzles.
